# deep-learning-user-recognition-motion-sensors
  Application of deep learning algorithms in user recognition based on motion sensors.

  Goal of this application is to find out if it possible to find some attributes of speakers who are speaking near smartphone in idle state (on nearby horizontal surface) based on values from accelerometer and gyroscope.

  We will try to predict 
    * background noise (low, medium, high)
    * language (Serbian, English, German)
    * distance from phone (0-2, 3-5, 5+ meters)
    * number of people speaking (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6+)
    * at least 1 male
    * at least 1 female
    * speakers years (<18, 18-30, >30)
    * certain letters or words ('a', 'knjiga', 'letter', 'schmetterling')
